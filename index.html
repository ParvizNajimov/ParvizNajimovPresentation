                <p>The French physicists Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson were the discoverers (–æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏) of the ozone
                    layer. In 1912, they managed to prove the existence of ozone in the outlying layers of the
                    atmosphere on earth. The ozone layer is a wide atmospheric belt (–ø–æ—è—Å) extending from 7 to 20 km
                    above the earth's surface.</p>

                    <p>The ozone layer, despite the small size, plays a huge role in preserving (—Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–∏) life on
                        earth. It absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the sun, which is hazardous to all living things.
                        From exposure (–≤–æ–∑–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ) to ultraviolet rays, the human immune system is broken, the growth
                        of cancerous (—Ä–∞–∫), infectious (–∏–Ω—Ñ–µ–∫—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–π) and viral (–≤–∏—Ä—É—Å–Ω—ã–π) diseases increase. –êll this
                        happens because life on the planet is adapted only to the soft spectrum of ultraviolet radiation
                        from the sun. Suffering from such a bad environment, not only humanity but also from ultraviolet
                        solar radiation falling into ocean waters, which leads to an increase in death rate among marine
                        animals and plants. –ê decrease in the ozone layer will lead to an increase in the heating of the
                        Earth, an increase in wind and a sharp (—Ä–µ–∑–∫–∏–π) change in climate.
                        As solution, for the condition of the environment, in 1947, politicians and scientists signed an
                        international agreement to reduce the use of ozone-depleting substances.</p>

                    The ozone layer is destroyed by the action of chemicals found in the ground, such as gas from a car,
                    hairspray, cleaning items, a refrigerator, and also a fire extinguisher.


                    , the consequences of the weakening of the ozone layer increase the flow of ultraviolet solar
                    radiation that penetrate the seas and destroy marine animals and plants.</p>

                         <p>A recent report published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found that space travel could be damaging the protective layer of our atmosphere: the ozone layer. According to the report, kerosene-burning rocket engines emit black carbon into the stratosphere, where a layer of ozone exists.</p>
